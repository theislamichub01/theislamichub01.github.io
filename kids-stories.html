                    <p>Long, long ago, there was a powerful king named Abraha who ruled Yemen. He built a huge, beautiful church and wanted everyone to visit it instead of the Kaaba in Makkah.</p>
                    
                    <p>But people still loved visiting the Kaaba, the sacred house built by Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) peace be upon him. This made King Abraha very angry!</p>
                    
                    <p>King Abraha decided to destroy the Kaaba. He gathered a huge army with many elephants - the biggest and strongest animals anyone had ever seen. The biggest elephant was named Mahmud.</p>
                    
                    <p>When the people of Makkah saw this huge army coming, they were very scared. They had no army to fight back! But they trusted Allah and prayed for His help.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the army got closer to Makkah, something amazing happened! The elephant Mahmud suddenly sat down and refused to move toward the Kaaba, no matter how hard the soldiers tried!</p>
                    
                    <p>Then, Allah sent thousands of small birds carrying tiny stones. These birds flew over the army and dropped the stones. Even though the stones were small, they were very powerful!</p>
                    
                    <p>The army of elephants ran away in fear, and King Abraha and his soldiers were defeated. Allah protected His sacred house without any human army!</p>
                    
                    <p>This amazing story is told in Surah Al-Fil (The Elephant) in the Quran. It happened in the same year that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was born.</p>

                    <p>Long ago, there was a tribe called Thamud who lived in beautiful homes carved into mountains. They were very rich and powerful, but they forgot to thank Allah.</p>
                    
                    <p>Allah sent Prophet Saleh to remind them to worship only Allah. But the people didn't want to listen. They said, "Show us a miracle, and then we'll believe you!"</p>
                    
                    <p>Prophet Saleh prayed to Allah, and Allah performed an amazing miracle. From a huge rock, a beautiful she-camel appeared! It was unlike any other camel - it was special and belonged to Allah.</p>
                    
                    <p>Prophet Saleh told the people, "This camel is a sign from Allah. She will drink from the well one day, and you can drink the next day. Do not harm her, or Allah will punish you!"</p>
                    
                    <p>For a while, the people followed this rule. But some evil people in the tribe became jealous of the camel. They didn't like sharing the water.</p>
                    
                    <p>One day, these evil people killed the she-camel, even though Prophet Saleh had warned them. Prophet Saleh was very sad and told them, "You have three more days to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness."</p>
                    
                    <p>But the people laughed and didn't believe anything would happen. After three days, a terrible earthquake struck, and the entire tribe
